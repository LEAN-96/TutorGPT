# TutorGPT

In this repository we will explore how to build a local and open-source Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) chatflow using [Flowise AI](https://flowiseai.com/). This project was part of the master study Digital Business Engineering at the Herman-Hollerith-Zentrum (HHZ) in the lecture Applied Machine Learning 

For the purpose of our project we have built an AI Tutor for the lecture of Distributed System.

# What is Flowise?

Flowise is an open source low-code tool for developers to build customized LLM orchestration flows & AI agents. Through a simple drag-and-drop UI approach it allows you to quickly prototype LLM applications.

# How to install Flowise?
Since we wanted to use all components of our system locally, we deployed Flowise locally using NPM. For other deployment options head over to their [documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/getting-started) or [Github](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise).
